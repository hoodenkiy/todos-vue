# Todo's App


## Run the project
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

A simple Vue checklist/todo app.

- Bootstrap is used for layout/css.
- To Edit todo's I chose to use a shared component VueQueQuickEdit which is good enough for the layout I designed. But if the todo had more editable properties it would make sense to implement a separate route for editing.
